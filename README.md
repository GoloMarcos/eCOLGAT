# Abstract 

We explore the problem of causal discovery between text pairs. We propose a new method called eCOLGAT (edge Classification through One-cLass Graph ATtention autoencoder) that exploits hypergraphs to better learn the representation of edges (causal relations), graph attention networks to perform edge classification in causal graphs, one-class learning to better model the problem and reduce the labeling effort, and interpretability to improve the understanding of the causal discovery learning process. eCOLGAT outperformed other one-class methods and large language models (state-of-the-art for causal discovery), proving to be a promising method for causal discovery in text pairs.
